# Recursion in Programming

## Introduction
Recursion is a programming technique that allows a function to call itself repeatedly. It's particularly useful for solving problems that have a recursive structure, such as finding the factorial of a number or calculating the Fibonacci sequence.

## How Recursion Works
When a function recurses, it creates a new instance of itself and passes in new arguments. The new instance executes, and upon completion, returns a value to the original instance. This returned value is then used by the original instance to calculate its own return value.

## Steps to Understand and Approach a Problem
1. Identify if a problem can be broken down into smaller problems.
2. Formulate the recurrence relation, if needed.
3. Visualize the recursive tree.
4. Analyze the function flow:
   - Understand the stack behavior.
   - Focus on left and right tree calls.
   - Utilize pen and paper to draw trees and pointers repeatedly.
5. Observe value returns at each step and identify the exit points.

## Example: Factorial
The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. A recursive function can be used to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. A recursive function can be used to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

## Benefits of Recursion
- Concise and understandable code.
- Efficient solution for problems with recursive structure.

## When to Use Recursion
Use recursion when the problem has a recursive structure and can be broken down into similar subproblems.

## When Not to Use Recursion
Avoid recursion for problems lacking a recursive structure, as it can lead to inefficiency.

## Conclusion
Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems, but it should be used judiciously to ensure efficiency.
